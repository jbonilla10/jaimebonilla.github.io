        <p>My name is Jaime Bonilla I was born on July 30, 1997 and I am from Round Lake, Illinois. I’m majoring in O.M.I.S and wanting to focus more on the I.S part. I am excited to have all O.M.I.S classes and cannot wait to learn of what O.M.I.S is all about. I have a little brother and two little sister who are 14, 9, and 6 years old.
            Something that I am proud of is that I am the first member in my family to go to a University.My favorite T.V shows that I like to watch are The Office, Prison Break and The Flash. Some other things I like to due during my free time is hangout with my friends, go to the gym and play video games. 
            Some of my biggest fears in life is letting people down (especially my mom), regret, and heights. My goal for this semester was to get at least a 3.5 gpa, be more involved in the College of Business, and making sure I don’t procrastinate on any of my assignment for my classes.</p>
