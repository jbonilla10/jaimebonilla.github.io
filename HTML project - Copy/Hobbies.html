    <p style="font-size:20px;"> Soccer is my favorite sport. Growing up soccer was all i played and till this day still enjoy playing. I played soccer since I was about 8 years and all throughout highschool. On top of that I also played two years of travel soccer in highland park with Chicago Magic. Soccer has taught me a lesson and for that I am grateful</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Combat Sports</h2>
    <p style="font-size:20px;" > Another one of my hobbies is watching combat sports like UFC,boxing, and muay thai. My dad is the one who really got me into combat sports because everytime I would be coming back from school he would be watching a boxing match. Some of my favorite boxers with be Canelo,Oscar de la hoya, and Roy Jones Jr. After boxing I started to watch the UFC and enjoyed it more then boxing because of the many fighting styles. Some of my favorite UFC fighters would Conor Mcgregor, Andersen Sliva, and Max Holloway. </p>
