												<h3>PS4</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The Slim PS4 is the more powerful machine, albeit slightly, with the ability to typically display games at a higher resolution. The difference isn’t always drastic, but on most TVs, PS4 titles will simply look better. There are some claims of the PS4 dropping frames on some games, and while it hasn’t been reported as a widespread issue — many games run at a smooth 30 or 60 frames per second without issue — it’s still worth keeping in mind.The DualShock 4, on the other hand, showcases vast improvements across the board when compared to the previous DualShock controllers. It’s bigger and comes outfitted with outward-curving triggers, along with a clickable touchpad on the front and a multifunctional lightbar. For ports only the PS4 comes with a camera port at this point. If you want to use Kinect on your Xbox One S or X, you’ll need an adapter that is now out of production. The PS4 is avaliable in 500GB or 1TB of storage space, which is enough to house a decent collection of games and other media. f you’re looking to get a console for its exclusives, however, you will want to get the PlayStation 4. Sony’s own first-party studios release multiple great exclusives for the system each year, such as God of War, Marvel’s Spider-Man, and the MLB: The Show series, and its third-party partners also develop exclusives such as Detroit: Become Human and Nioh.

												<h3>Xbox One</h3>
											</header>
											<p> Xbox One X is capable of running many games at a native 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, consistently outperforming Sony’s <br> premium console.The standard Xbox One controller retains many of the core elements</br> of the 360 controller, plus it adds two more rumble motors and loses the bulky battery pack on the back. It also has smaller thumb pads on the analog sticks, which some will find refreshing, <br> frustrating. For ports Microsoft packed an IR Blaster and two HDMI inputs into the One, thus allowing you to connect the console to satellite boxes and cable TV.</br> The Xbox one is avaliable in 500GB or 1TB of storage space, which is enough to house a decent collection of games and other media. <br> The Xbox One, meanwhile, has few noteworthy exclusive games each year. Aside from big series like Forza, Halo, and Gears of War, the exclusives we’ve seen for the Xbox One are lackluster.</br> There are exceptions, such as Sunset Overdrive and the inventive pirate game Sea of Thieves, but these pale in comparison to what Sony offers its players.
