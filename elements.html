					<p>PS4 is a multi-faceted console with plenty of unique features and a bustling library of worthwhile exclusives. Players looking for expansive JRPGs and niche experiences will find so much to love PS4, as well as gaining the upper hand in performance with the majority of third-party titles.
						PS4 Pro has come into its own since its release, offering benefits beyond its 4K upscaling with its newly introduced Boost Mode. PlayStation VR is the cherry-on-top for PS4 owners, so long as you’re willing to invest in the fancy new peripheral.
						Xbox One is also a brilliant option to consider, boasting the likes of Halo, Forza and Gears of War under its blockbuster umbrella. Ever since Phil Spencer took charge of the brand we’ve seen the focus shift towards games, despite the cancellation of high-profile exclusives like Scalebound.
You also have Xbox Play Anywhere, a service that gives you 2 digital games for the price of one across Xbox One and Windows 10. The recent release of Xbox One S will more than certainly keep us entertained until the arrival of Project Scorpio later this year.
