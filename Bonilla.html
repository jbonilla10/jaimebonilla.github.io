<div class="class"><p>Something i did from chapter 4 was the background image. 
   <br> The reason I did this was because it made my web page look <br> 
    and it would let people know what i look like.</p></div>

<div class="class"> <p> Another thing i did from chapter 4 was the <br> positioning of my image. 
    instead of <br> having it in the center i 
    decided to put it <br> in the top right of my webpage.</p></div>
