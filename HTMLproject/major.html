    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Major</h2>
    <p style="font-size:25px;"> My major at Northern Illinois Univeristy is Operations Management and Information Systems. At first I was an accounting major but after taking 206 and 207 I knew accounting was not for me. So I switched to OMIS because I was really into technology. I knew that OMIS was a good major and that a lot of company were looking for tech savvy people that knew a lot of softwares. </p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Minor</h2>
    <p style="font-size:25px;" > I decided to go with a minor in data analytics because of how attractive it sounds to many companies. I knew that data analytics was a great minor and many companies wanted people who can analysis big data. On top of that data analytics and OMIS very well together. </p>
